# Othello Game Simulation in Java
Welcome to the Othello game simulation in Java! This project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly and fun implementation of the classic Othello game. This implementation of the game is developed using object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Requirements
An IDE that compiles Java code

## How to play
The game can be played in the terminal. Download the source code, compile, and run the Driver.java file. Follow the instructions on your console and enjoy!

## Game rules
The objective of the game is to place your chips in such a way that you have more chips than your opponent when the board is full. The rules are simple:

- You can only place chips on an empty square
- You must place chips so that an opponent's chip is surrounded by your chips on both the left and right sides (or top and bottom).
- The opponent's surrounded chips will be flipped to your color.
- The game ends when there are no more moves left for either player or when the board is full.

## Features
- Implementation of the Othello game using inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Ability to play the game in the terminal.

## Future improvements
- Implementation of a GUI to play the game.
- Option to save and load games.
- Fix minor bugs.
